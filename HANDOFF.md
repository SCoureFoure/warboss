# HANDOFF — the relay between ranks

> The adjacency rule applied to our own workflow. The planner (high tier) writes
> a work item here pointing at a frozen spec; the implementer (lower tier) builds
> to the spec and writes its report back in the same item. Neither rank edits the
> other's section. This file is the only channel — no side instructions.

## Protocol

**Planner writes** (before handoff):

- One work item per change set, pointing at the spec(s) that govern it.
- Scope checklist — concrete deliverables, no interpretation latitude.
- Pre-answered questions ("notes down") — anything the spec doesn't carry but
  the implementer might trip on.

**Implementer writes** (in the item's _Report back_ section, after building):

- `Done:` what was built, file list.
- `Deviations:` anywhere the result differs from spec, and why. A deviation
  without a why is a defect. Judgment calls count — if you chose between two
  readings or declined a REUSE note, report it even when you're sure.
- `Gaps found:` underspecification hit during build. **Fail-up dogma: do not
  resolve ambiguity yourself — implement the most literal reading, mark it
  `// UNDECIDED:` in code, and list it here.** Gaps feed the next spec rev.
- `Verify:` exact output of `npm run typecheck` + `npm test` (pass counts),
  plus any smoke/live run made.
- `Cost/time:` rough wall time; token/dollar cost if model calls were made.

**Rules:**

1. The spec is frozen for the duration of a work item. Implementer never edits
   `specs/*.spec.md` — gaps go in _Report back_, planner amends the spec.
2. Status ladder: `queued → in-progress → built (report filed) → accepted`.
   Only the planner moves an item to `accepted` (after reviewing the report).
3. Item IDs are `H-<n>`, never reused. The one-line log below is the index;
   accepted items' full bodies (scope, notes, report, verdict) move to
   [HANDOFF-archive.md](HANDOFF-archive.md) — together they are the project's
   decision/handoff history.
4. Dispatched implementers work in their assigned worktree and commit there —
   the dispatch prompt pins the working directory explicitly (H-10 lesson:
   a grunt resolved "this repository" to the main checkout).

**Standing notes for the next leg** (carried from H-1…H-11 reviews):

- Spec gaps to fold into the next `warboss-decomposition` rev: audit double
  parse-failure currently fail-opens to `gaps = []` (decide: throw vs sentinel
  in `auditGaps`); `auditGaps` entry format is `"<id>: <gap>"` — pin it.
  Cosmetic: spec's audit prompt has a stray space (`"} . Empty`).
- Entropy-reduction authoring mandates are binding for every new spec/AC
  (`specs/README.md` Rules): every normative sentence maps to an AC that fails
  when violated; kill second readings with an example; one AC per state
  transition.
- Offline trick: an EMPTY fake-client response is the only way to force
  `generationFailed` — `extractCode` falls back to raw trimmed text.
- God-gated live spends queued: E1b economics run, gate calibration
  experiment, first live decomposition.
